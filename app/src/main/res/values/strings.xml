    <string name="read_me">Storm is a distributed realtime computation system. Similar to how Hadoop provides a set
        of general primitives for doing batch processing, Storm provides a set of general primitives for doing realtime
        computation. Storm is simple, can be used with any programming language, is used by many companies, and is a lot of fun to use!
        The Rationale page explains what Storm is and why it was built. This presentation is also a good introduction to the project.
        Storm has a website at storm.apache.org. Follow @stormprocessor on Twitter for updates on the project.\n
